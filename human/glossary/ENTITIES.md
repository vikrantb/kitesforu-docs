## Content Entities

These are the things a user can create.

### Quick Audio

A single AI-generated audio episode on any topic. 5-30 minutes. One topic, one episode, done.

| Icon | 🎙 |
| Nav label | "Quick Audio" |
| Default duration | 10 minutes |
| Creation route | `/create-smart?template=topic-explainer` |

**When to use:** The user wants a standalone audio piece. No series, no curriculum. Just pick a topic and generate.

**Examples:** "Explain quantum computing", "History of jazz", "How to negotiate salary"

## Supporting Concepts

### Episode
One audio file within an Audio Series. Has a title, script, and generated audio. Episodes are ordered by the curriculum.

### Lesson
One audio file within a Classroom. Same as an episode but includes a quiz. Lessons are ordered by the class curriculum.

### Quiz
Multiple-choice comprehension questions auto-generated from lesson content. Attached to each Lesson.

### Curriculum
The outline/syllabus for an Audio Series or Classroom. Defines the order, titles, and descriptions of episodes/lessons. Generated by AI, reviewed by the user before audio generation begins.

### Template
A pre-configured starting point for creation. Each template maps to a content type with pre-filled settings (topic style, duration, episode count). Examples: "Topic Explainer", "Exam Review", "Horror Series."

### Smart Create
The AI-guided creation flow. The user describes what they want (or picks a template), and the AI asks clarifying questions before generating a plan. Available in two modes:
- **Chat mode** (default) — conversational, one question at a time
- **Batch mode** — form-based, fill everything at once

---

## Developer Cross-Reference

| User-facing name | Internal type | API field value | Firestore collection | Activity API `content_type_label` |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Quick Audio | `podcast` | `podcast` | `podcast_jobs` | "Quick Audio" |
| Audio Series | `course` | `course` | `courses` | "Audio Series" |
| Interview Prep | `course` | `course` | `courses` | "Audio Series" (style=Interview) |
| Classroom | `class` | `class` | `classes` | "Classroom" |
| Writing | `writeup` | `writeup` | `writeups` | Format-specific (e.g., "Blog Post") |

---

## Terminology Rules

1. **Always use the user-facing name** in UI copy, tooltips, error messages, and documentation.
2. **Internal types are fine in code** — `podcast`, `course`, `class`, `writeup` are acceptable in variable names, API routes, and Firestore queries.
3. **Never show internal types to users** — the user should never see "podcast_jobs" or "course" where "Quick Audio" or "Audio Series" is meant.
4. **"Study Guide" and "Creative Story" are templates**, not entity types. They both create Audio Series under the hood.
5. **Interview Prep is technically a course** with `style: 'Interview'`. It gets its own nav item because the use case is distinct enough.
