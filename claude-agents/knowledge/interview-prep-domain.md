# Interview Prep Domain Expertise
<!-- last_verified: 2026-02-07 -->

## What Makes Great Interview Prep

### The Core Problem
Most interview prep is generic. "Tell me about yourself" advice that applies to everyone equally helps no one specifically. Great prep is:
1. **Candidate-specific**: References actual resume content, actual experience, actual gaps
2. **Company-specific**: Knows the company's interview style, values, recent news
3. **Role-specific**: Understands what THIS level at THIS company actually evaluates
4. **Actionable**: Every piece of advice includes a concrete practice exercise

### Quality Bar
Every episode title should be specific enough that a stranger could guess the candidate's target role from the title alone.
- BAD: "Introduction to Technical Interviews"
- GOOD: "Bridging Your AWS Lambda Experience to Google's Cloud Functions Design Questions"

## Geography-Specific Interview Patterns

### United States
- **Style**: Structured behavioral (STAR method dominant), technical deep-dives
- **Culture fit**: "Culture add" framing, diversity/inclusion awareness
- **Key frameworks**: STAR, CAR (Challenge-Action-Result)
- **Unique aspects**: At-will employment context, salary negotiation expected, "tell me about a time" format
- **Big tech pattern**: Phone screen -> Technical rounds (2-4) -> System design -> Behavioral -> Team match
- **Common mistakes**: Being too humble (underselling), not quantifying impact
- **Salary negotiation**: Expected and respected; not negotiating is often seen as a negative signal at senior levels
- **Timeline**: Offer decisions often within 1-2 weeks; candidates should express urgency strategically

### United Kingdom
- **Style**: Competency-based interviews, structured scoring matrices
- **Culture fit**: More formal than US, emphasis on teamwork and stakeholder management
- **Key frameworks**: STAR but with emphasis on "situation" context
- **Unique aspects**: Notice periods (1-3 months standard), right to work verification emphasis
- **Common mistakes**: Being too direct/aggressive (perceived as American style)
- **Graduate schemes**: Major hiring pipeline; structured 2-year rotational programmes at large firms
- **Tone**: Understated confidence valued over self-promotion; "we" language often preferred

### India
- **Style**: Technical-heavy for IT, group discussions for management
- **Culture fit**: Hierarchy awareness, respect for seniority, team orientation

- **Culture fit**: Cultural sensitivity, international experience valued
- **Unique aspects**: Visa/sponsorship implications, Arabization/Emiratization policies, tax-free salary structures
- **Common mistakes**: Not understanding sponsorship model, ignoring cultural norms around business relationships
- **Tech hubs**: Dubai and Riyadh investing heavily in tech; interview processes at NEOM, Careem-style companies blend Western and regional patterns

### Australia / New Zealand
- **Style**: Informal but structured, behavioral-heavy, practical demonstration valued
- **Culture fit**: "Tall poppy syndrome" awareness -- don't oversell, demonstrate competence through examples not claims
- **Unique aspects**: Skilled migration visa considerations, "mateship" culture values team orientation
- **Common mistakes**: Overly formal or aggressive approach, not adapting to relaxed communication style

### Latin America
- **Style**: Relationship-driven, personal connection matters, technical skills often tested via take-home projects
- **Brazil**: Growing tech scene, English fluency is a differentiator, remote-first culture emerging
- **Mexico**: Nearshoring boom creating US-aligned interview processes, bilingual ability highly valued
- **Common mistakes**: Ignoring the relationship-building phase, being too transactional

- **What they evaluate**: Structured thinking, communication clarity, hypothesis-driven approach, executive presence
- **Case interview frameworks**: Profitability, market entry, M&A, pricing, operations, growth strategy
- **By firm**:
  - McKinsey: PEI (Personal Experience Interview), interviewer-led cases, emphasis on "distinctive" insights
  - BCG: Candidate-led cases, more open-ended, chart/data interpretation heavy
  - Bain: Similar to BCG, emphasis on results/recommendations, "true north" thinking
  - Big 4 (Deloitte/PwC/EY/KPMG): Mix of fit + mini-cases, more industry-specific, less purely analytical
  - Boutique (Oliver Wyman, LEK, etc.): Deeper industry expertise expected, smaller case sample sizes
- **Common mistakes**: Forcing frameworks instead of thinking from first principles, not asking clarifying questions, forgetting to conclude with a recommendation
- **Case math**: Practice mental math daily; candidates who pause for 60 seconds to compute lose credibility

### Government / Public Sector
- **Interview structure**: Structured panel, competency-based scoring
- **What they evaluate**: Public service motivation, policy understanding, collaboration, impartiality
- **Unique aspects**: Pre-defined scoring rubrics, diversity quotas, security clearances, standardized pay bands
- **Common mistakes**: Private sector jargon, profit-focused answers, not demonstrating public service motivation

## Interview Format Deep Dives

### Behavioral Interviews
- **Framework**: STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) + Learning
- **Story bank**: Candidates need 8-12 stories covering: leadership, conflict, failure, innovation, teamwork, customer focus, dealing with ambiguity, time pressure
- **Anti-patterns**:
  - "We did X" instead of "I did X" (ownership unclear)
  - Stories without quantified results
  - Only positive outcomes (interviewers want to see failure + learning)
  - Rehearsed-sounding delivery
  - Stories older than 3 years (seems like you haven't done anything recently)
- **Advanced technique**: Map stories to company values BEFORE the interview; have a matrix of stories x values
- **Recovery strategy**: If you realize mid-story it's not landing, say "Let me give you a more relevant example" and pivot
- **Story calibration by level**:
  - Junior: "I contributed to X" is fine
  - Mid: "I led/owned X" is expected
  - Senior: "I influenced/drove X across teams" is necessary
  - Staff+: "I changed how the organization approaches X" is the bar

### System Design Interviews
- **Framework**: Requirements -> High-level design -> Deep dive -> Trade-offs -> Scaling
- **What interviewers evaluate**:
  - Can you break down ambiguous requirements?
  - Do you consider trade-offs (consistency vs availability, cost vs performance)?
  - Can you estimate scale (back-of-envelope calculations)?
  - Do you know real systems (not just textbook patterns)?
  - Do you drive the conversation or need constant prompting?
- **Common topics**: URL shortener, chat system, news feed, rate limiter, distributed cache, video streaming, search autocomplete, notification system, payment system, ride-sharing
- **Anti-patterns**: Jumping to solution without clarifying requirements, ignoring non-functional requirements, not discussing monitoring/observability, over-engineering for the given scale
- **Pro tip**: Start with functional requirements, then non-functional (latency, throughput, availability, consistency), then capacity estimation, THEN design
- **By level**:
  - Mid: Show you can design a working system with reasonable components
  - Senior: Show you can make trade-offs and explain WHY you chose each component
  - Staff+: Show you can design for evolution (how does this system change in 2 years?)

### Case Study Interviews
- **Framework**: Structure -> Hypothesis -> Analysis -> Recommendation
- **Key skills**: Break down problems, do math on the spot, present conclusions clearly
- **Types**: Market sizing, profitability, market entry, M&A, operations, growth strategy, new product
- **Anti-patterns**: Rigid framework application, not adapting to interviewer hints, forgetting to synthesize at the end
- **Market sizing tips**: Always state assumptions clearly, round aggressively, sanity-check your answer against known benchmarks
- **Profitability framework**: Revenue (price x volume) vs Cost (fixed + variable); segment by product/region/customer; look for trends

### Panel Interviews
- **Key skill**: Address multiple evaluators, read the room
- **Strategy**: Direct answers to the questioner, but include others with eye contact
- **Anti-pattern**: Only engaging with one panelist (usually the most senior)
- **Power dynamics**: Identify the decision-maker vs the technical evaluator vs the culture assessor; tailor your communication style to each
- **Follow-up**: Send personalized thank-you notes referencing specific discussion points with EACH panelist

### Take-Home / Portfolio Reviews
- **Key skill**: Clean code, documentation, explaining decisions
- **Strategy**: Show trade-off thinking ("I chose X over Y because...")
- **Anti-pattern**: Over-engineering, not including a README, no test coverage, spending 20 hours on a "4-hour" project
- **What they actually evaluate**: Code organization, naming, error handling, testing approach, documentation quality, git commit history
- **Pro tip**: Include a DECISIONS.md explaining your architectural choices and trade-offs; this is what senior engineers do

### Live Coding / Pair Programming
- **Key skill**: Think out loud, collaborate, write clean code under pressure
- **Strategy**: Clarify requirements, discuss approach BEFORE coding, write tests first if possible
- **Anti-patterns**: Silent coding, not handling edge cases, not testing your solution, writing clever code instead of clear code
- **Communication**: Narrate your thinking -- "I'm considering two approaches here... I'll go with X because..."
- **If stuck**: Say "I'm stuck on X. My instinct is Y, but I'm not confident. Can I talk through my thinking?" -- interviewers WANT to help you succeed

### AI-Proctored / Async Video Interviews (HireVue, Pymetrics)
- **Key skill**: Natural delivery to camera, concise answers within time limits
- **Strategy**: Practice recording yourself, maintain eye contact with camera (not screen), structured answers within 60-90 seconds
- **Anti-patterns**: Reading from notes (detectable), looking away from camera, rambling past time limit
- **Unique challenge**: No interviewer feedback to gauge if your answer landed; must be self-contained

## Level-Specific Coaching

### Junior / Entry Level (0-2 years)
- **Focus**: Technical fundamentals, eagerness to learn, cultural fit
- **Strengths to emphasize**: Fresh perspective, up-to-date education, energy, adaptability
- **Weaknesses to address**: Lack of industry experience -> reframe as relevant projects/internships
- **Coaching approach**: Build confidence, practice fundamentals, reduce anxiety
- **Key message to internalize**: "I may not have 10 years of experience, but I bring current knowledge, high energy, and a track record of rapid learning"
- **Resume gaps**: Bootcamp, open source contributions, personal projects, freelance work -- all count when framed correctly
- **Negotiation**: Even at entry level, negotiate; research market rates on levels.fyi, Glassdoor; always have a number ready

### Mid-Level (3-5 years)
- **Focus**: Ownership, execution, growing scope of impact
- **Strengths to emphasize**: Track record of delivery, specific technical expertise, growing independence
- **Weaknesses to address**: Limited leadership experience -> reframe as informal mentoring, tech lead of small team
- **Coaching approach**: Elevate from "I did the work" to "I drove the outcome"
- **Key message to internalize**: "I independently deliver high-quality work and am ready to take on larger scope"
- **Leveling trap**: Many mid-level candidates interview at the same level; coach them to aim one level up and prepare accordingly
- **Impact framing**: Always quantify -- "reduced build time by 40%", "served 2M daily active users", "mentored 3 junior engineers"

### Senior (5-10 years)
- **Focus**: Technical leadership, cross-team influence, architectural thinking
- **Strengths to emphasize**: Large-scale impact, mentoring others, technical strategy
- **Key evaluation**: "Can this person operate independently and multiply the team's output?"
- **Coaching approach**: Practice explaining complex decisions simply, demonstrate organizational impact
- **Key message to internalize**: "I don't just solve problems, I prevent them and help others solve them"
- **Common gap**: Many senior engineers have deep technical skills but weak "influence without authority" stories; coach them to find and articulate these
- **System design depth**: At this level, interviewers expect you to know WHY systems are designed certain ways, not just what the components are

### Staff / Principal (10+ years)
- **Focus**: Vision, organizational impact, technical strategy, talent development
- **Strengths to emphasize**: Company-wide influence, industry recognition, setting technical direction
- **Key evaluation**: "Can this person shape our technical future?"
- **Coaching approach**: Think in terms of systems and organizations, not just code
- **Key message to internalize**: "I make the organization better at building software, not just the software itself"
- **Interview format difference**: Less coding, more design discussions, more "tell me about how you changed X at an organizational level"
- **Narrative arc**: Staff+ interviews require a coherent career narrative -- each role should build toward a technical leadership theme
- **Writing samples**: Many staff+ roles evaluate written communication; have 2-3 design documents or RFCs ready to discuss

### Management Track
- **Focus**: Team building, stakeholder management, delivery, strategy
- **Key difference from IC track**: People skills, conflict resolution, performance management
- **Coaching approach**: Prepare for "how would you handle..." scenarios with direct reports
- **Core scenarios to prepare**:
  - Underperforming team member (PIP process, coaching, eventual termination if needed)
  - Team conflict between two strong engineers
  - Stakeholder pushing unrealistic deadline
  - Inheriting a demoralized team
  - Making a tough technical decision the team disagrees with
  - Retaining a top performer who got an outside offer
- **Key evaluation**: "Would I want to work FOR this person?" -- not just "with" them
- **EM vs Director**: EM = team execution + people management; Director = multi-team strategy + organizational design

## Resume-to-JD Gap Analysis Framework

### How to Identify Gaps
1. **Keyword extraction**: Pull every requirement from the JD (tools, skills, experiences, soft skills)
2. **Resume mapping**: For each JD keyword, find the closest match in the resume
3. **Gap classification**:
   - **Direct match**: Resume explicitly mentions the skill/experience
   - **Transferable**: Resume has analogous experience in different context
   - **Learnable gap**: Can be credibly addressed with "I've studied X and here's my approach"
   - **Hard gap**: Fundamental experience missing (e.g., JD requires 5 years management, candidate has 0)
4. **Prioritization**: Rank gaps by how likely they are to be asked about in the interview

### How to Coach Each Gap Type
- **Direct match**: Build strong, specific stories with quantified results
- **Transferable**: Build bridge narratives -- "While I haven't used X directly, my experience with Y means I understand the underlying principles because..."
- **Learnable gap**: Demonstrate proactive learning -- "I've been studying X through [course/project/book] and here's what I understand about how it applies to this role..."
- **Hard gap**: Be honest but redirect -- "I don't have X experience yet, but I bring Z which is equally valuable because..." (only works if Z is genuinely differentiating)

### Red Flags in Gap Analysis
- More than 3 hard gaps: Candidate may be reaching too far
- All gaps in core requirements (vs nice-to-haves): High risk of rejection
- Gaps in the company's publicly stated values: Must address directly

## Company Research Framework

### What to Research (and How to Use It)

1. **Recent earnings/funding**: Understand business health; reference in "why this company" answer
2. **Recent product launches**: Shows you follow the company; connect to your skills
3. **Engineering blog posts**: Understand their tech stack, challenges, culture
4. **Glassdoor/Blind reviews**: Understand real culture (not just marketing); prepare for culture-fit questions
5. **Interview process reviews**: Know the format, number of rounds, common questions
6. **Leadership team changes**: New CTO/VP Eng often means new priorities; align your narrative
7. **Competitors and market position**: Demonstrate industry awareness; valuable for "where do you see this company in 5 years" questions
8. **Open source contributions**: Shows technical culture; reference specific repos if relevant to your skills

### How to Weave Research Into Answers
- NOT: "I read that you just raised $100M" (empty name-drop)
- YES: "I noticed your Series C announcement mentioned expanding into enterprise. My experience building SOC2-compliant systems at [Company] directly maps to that challenge because..."

---

## Psychological Preparation

### Managing Interview Anxiety
- **Reframe the interview**: It's a mutual evaluation, not a judgment. You're interviewing THEM too.
- **Power posing**: 2 minutes of expansive posture before the interview (research-backed confidence boost)
- **Preparation reduces anxiety**: The more specific your prep, the less anxiety you'll feel
- **Breathing technique**: 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s) before entering the room
- **Visualization**: Walk through the interview mentally the night before; visualize handling a tough question gracefully

### Handling Rejection
- **Reframe**: Rejection is information, not judgment. Many rejections are about timing, team needs, or fit -- not competence.
- **Debrief**: After every rejection, write down what went well and what didn't. Look for patterns across multiple interviews.
- **Timeboxed grief**: Allow yourself 24 hours to be disappointed, then move to action
- **Numbers game**: Senior roles often take 5-15 interview cycles to land. Normalize the process.

### Imposter Syndrome Coaching
- **Evidence collection**: Before the interview, list 5 concrete things you've accomplished. Read them aloud.
- **Comparison trap**: You're comparing your inside (doubts) to others' outside (confidence). Everyone feels this way.
- **Permission to be nervous**: Saying "I'm excited about this opportunity" channels the same physiological response as anxiety but reframes it positively.

## Salary Negotiation Coaching

### Principles
1. **Never give a number first**: "I'd love to understand the full compensation package before discussing numbers"
2. **Research**: levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Blind, industry surveys -- know the range before the conversation
3. **Total comp**: Base + bonus + equity + benefits + signing bonus. Never evaluate base alone.
4. **Competing offers**: The strongest negotiation lever. Multiple processes in parallel is the strategy.
5. **Timing**: Negotiate AFTER the offer, never during interviews. Once they want you, leverage shifts.

### Geography-Specific Negotiation
- **US**: Aggressive negotiation expected and respected; "I was hoping for X based on my research"
- **UK**: More subtle; "I was expecting something closer to X given the market"
- **India**: Negotiate CTC, not just base; understand components (basic, HRA, special allowance, PF)
- **Japan**: Negotiation less common for shinsotsu; mid-career has more room; be respectful but clear
- **Germany**: Structured salary bands but negotiation possible; reference collective agreements (Tarifvertrag) as benchmarks

### Equity Coaching
- **Startups**: Explain vesting (4-year cliff + monthly vesting standard), dilution, preference stacks, 409A valuation
- **Public companies**: RSU vesting schedules, refreshers, tax implications (RSUs taxed as income on vest)
- **Key question to ask**: "What's the refresh grant policy?" -- this matters more than initial grant for long tenure

## Common Anti-Patterns in Interview Prep Products

1. **Generic advice**: "Research the company" without saying WHAT to research or HOW to use it
2. **One-size-fits-all**: Same advice for junior and senior candidates
3. **US-centric**: STAR method presented as universal when it's culturally specific
4. **Theory without practice**: Explaining frameworks without providing actual practice questions
5. **Ignoring the "why"**: Teaching techniques without explaining what the interviewer is evaluating
6. **No personalization**: Same episode content regardless of candidate's actual background
7. **Positive-only**: Only teaching how to give "good" answers, not how to recover from mistakes
8. **Outdated**: Using interview patterns from 5 years ago (tech interviews evolve rapidly)
9. **No feedback loop**: Prep without mock interviews or self-assessment is theater
10. **Ignoring logistics**: Not coaching on scheduling strategy, thank-you notes, follow-up timing

---

## What Our Product Should Do Better

### Content Generation Principles
1. **Gap analysis first**: Before ANY content, analyze resume vs JD to find real gaps
2. **Specific practice questions**: Not "practice behavioral questions" but "Tell me about a time you had to scale a system under pressure -- here's how to structure your answer using your AWS migration project from 2024"
3. **Company-specific research**: Include recent company news, culture signals, interview format specifics
4. **Level-calibrated**: Different coaching tone and content depth for different levels
5. **Industry-aware**: Finance candidates get different advice than tech candidates
6. **Geography-aware**: Adjust coaching style for cultural context
7. **Mock with feedback**: Simulate real interviews and explain what the interviewer was evaluating
8. **Recovery coaching**: Teach how to handle "I don't know" and curveball questions gracefully

### Episode Structure Best Practices
- **Opening**: Acknowledge the candidate's specific situation (role, company, experience level)
- **Gap identification**: "Based on your resume and the JD, the areas that need the most attention are..."
- **Targeted coaching**: Deep dive into the top 2-3 gaps with specific advice
- **Practice exercises**: Actual questions the candidate should practice, with model answers that reference THEIR experience
- **Confidence building**: End with what the candidate brings that IS a strong match
- **Call to action**: Specific homework between episodes

### Quality Signals in Generated Content
- Episode references specific resume items by name (projects, companies, technologies)
- Episode references specific JD requirements and how to address them
- Advice differs meaningfully between a junior and senior candidate for the same role
- Practice questions are company-specific (not generic "tell me about yourself")
- Coaching acknowledges cultural context if candidate/company are in different geographies
- Trade-offs are discussed (not just "do this")
- Recovery strategies are included (not just happy paths)

### Differentiation from Competitors
- **vs generic courses (Coursera, Udemy)**: We're personalized to YOUR resume and YOUR target role
- **vs coaching services (Exponent, interviewing.io)**: We're available 24/7, scalable, and more affordable
- **vs mock interview platforms**: We combine coaching + mock + feedback in a single experience
- **vs ChatGPT/generic AI**: We have structured domain expertise, not just language generation
- **vs career coaches**: We supplement (not replace) human coaching with scalable, always-available prep

## Interview Recovery Techniques

### When You Don't Know the Answer
- **Acknowledge honestly**: "I don't have direct experience with that, but here's how I'd approach it..."
- **Show your process**: Walk through how you'd figure it out (Google, docs, colleagues, experimentation)
- **Bridge to strength**: "While I haven't used X, I've extensively used Y which solves a similar problem"
- **Never bluff**: Experienced interviewers can tell. Honesty + problem-solving > fake confidence.

### When You Make a Mistake Mid-Answer
- **Catch and correct**: "Actually, let me revise that -- I said X but I meant Y because..."
- **Don't pretend it didn't happen**: Self-awareness is a positive signal
- **Keep composure**: One mistake doesn't kill an interview; panic after a mistake does

### When You're Asked an Illegal/Inappropriate Question
- **Redirect gracefully**: "I'd prefer to focus on how my skills align with the role"
- **Know your rights**: Age, family status, religion, nationality -- know what's off-limits in your jurisdiction
- **Use it as signal**: Inappropriate questions may indicate a problematic workplace

### When the Interviewer is Hostile/Disengaged
- **Don't match energy**: Stay professional and enthusiastic
- **Stress test possibility**: Some interviewers are deliberately difficult to test your composure
- **Shorten answers**: If they're disengaged, give concise answers and ask if they'd like more detail
- **Post-interview**: Factor this into your evaluation of the company
