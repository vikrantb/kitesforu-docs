## Script Quality Standards
Based on shared quality guidelines in kitesforu-workers:
- **5-Second Rule**: Every 5 seconds must deliver a fact, insight, example, or meaningful question
- **Banned patterns**: "That's interesting", "Many people think", "It's growing", "Recently" (replace with specifics)
- **Information density**: Specific facts, statistics, examples — never vague statements
- **Anti-repetition**: Each segment must provide unique information

## Audio Quality Standards
- No TTS artifacts or stitching glitches
- Appropriate voice for persona
- Natural pacing with proper pauses
- Smooth transitions between segments
- Consistent volume throughout
